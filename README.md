## 🛰️ Routing Visualizer Tool

A dynamic, interactive web-based visualizer for understanding how computer networks compute optimal paths using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** and the **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**.

### 🔍 About the Project

This tool allows users to **visualize and interact with network routing algorithms** step by step. Built with **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **[Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/)** for graph rendering, the tool is designed to help learners and developers grasp the internal workings of common shortest path algorithms in networking.

### ✨ Features

* 🖱️ **Interactive Network Creation**
  Generate custom graphs by adding nodes and edges, or load a pre-defined example network.

* 🛣️ **Algorithm Selection**
  Choose between **Dijkstra** or **Bellman-Ford** to calculate the shortest path.

* 🔍 **Step-by-Step Visualization**
  See how each algorithm works in real time:

  * Nodes and edges update visually with color-coded changes.
  * Cost tables display updates beneath the graph in sync with each step.

* 🔄 **Live Updates**
  The visualizer dynamically shows the algorithm's decision-making process, making it easy to follow how shortest paths are calculated.

### 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Languages**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
* **Library**: [Cytoscape.js](https://js.cytoscape.org/) for graph rendering and manipulation

### 🚀 Usage

1. Open the tool in your browser.
2. Create a network manually or load the default example.
3. Select a source and destination node.
4. Choose an algorithm.
5. Watch the routing process unfold visually and in the cost table below.
